- Day 4:
        for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
        while loops for iteration based on a condition.
        do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
        Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
        Use loop control statements (break and continue ) to control the flow of loops.
